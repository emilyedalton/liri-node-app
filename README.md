# liri-node-app

LIRI (Language Intrepretation and Recognition Interface) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data to the user. 


LIRI uses three REST APIs to answer user questions about live music performances, information about specific songs, and information about specific films. 


This app uses Axios to make http requests from node.js to the Bands in Town API and and the OMDB API.
